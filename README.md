# Expression Components

`Expression Components` is a UI library included that can be deployed independently of the core library.
These components give you powerful configuration abilities, as their configuration properties are powered
by the `Expression` language.

## Installation

### Unlocked Package (`expression` namespace)

[![Install Unlocked Package in a Sandbox](assets/btn-install-unlocked-package-sandbox.png)](https://test.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04tHu000003OWFLIA4)
[![Install Unlocked Package in Production](assets/btn-install-unlocked-package-production.png)](https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04tHu000003OWFLIA4)

Install with SF CLI:

```shell
sf package install --apex-compile package --wait 20 --package 04tHu000003OWFLIA4
```

Install with SFDX CLI:

```shell
sfdx force:package:install --apexcompile package --wait 20 --package 04tHu000003OWFLIA4
```

## Site Context

### Query Parameters

From any expression you can access query parameters for the current page using
the global context variable prefix `@` followed by the query parameter name:

```apex
"Hello $ { @ name }"
```

where `name` is a query parameter in the current page.
For the full Expression language documentation,
please visit [cesarparra.github.io/expression/](cesarparra.github.io/expression/).

> ðŸ““ All components supported in communities are meant to be used within an LWR template. They might
> work in Aura templates, but keep in mind they developed and tested with LWR in mind.

### Formula

The `Formula` component allows you to evaluate an expression and display the result. It can be used
in a record page or in a community page.

When using in a record page, the record Id is automatically used as the context of the expression.

When using in a community page, you can optionally specify the context by setting the `Record Id` property. This can
receive the record Id directly or in the form of a merge field, e.g. `{!recordId}` which will be replaced
with the value of the `recordId` URL parameter.

> Keep in mind that if a record Id is not specified, the expression provided should not contain any merge field
> references.

#### Properties

- `Record Id` - The record Id to use as the context of the expression. This can be a merge field, e.g. `{!recordId}`.
  Only
  used when the component is used in a community page.
- `Title` - The card title.
- `Formula Expression` - The expression to evaluate.

#### Sample Usage

Placing the component in an Account page and using the following formula:

```bash
"Account Name: " + Name + BR(2) + "Rating: " + CASE(Rating, "Hot", "ðŸ”¥", "Cold", "ðŸ§Š", "ðŸ¤·")
```

Results in the following. Note that the component reacts to changes in the record and updates
itself based on the new values when placed in a record page.

### Form

The `Form` component exposes a region where you can place other Expression components inside. This
allows you to essentially "build" a form that then be submitted through a `Button` component with a
`submit` type.

Submitted forms will pass all the information of any embedded input components within the region
to the Apex class specified in the `src` handler of the `Button`.

### Button

> `Form` compatible

The `Button` component allows you to display a button that can be used to trigger an action or navigate to a URL.
It can be used in a community page.

#### Properties

- `Formula Expression` - The expression to evaluate. This expression should evaluate to a map with the following format:

* `label` - Expression that evaluates to a String - The label to display on the button.
* `type` - Expression that evaluates to a String - The type of button to display. Valid values
  are `submit`, `action`, `navigation_namedPage`, `navigation_url`
* `src` - Depending on the `type` specified, this can hold one of the following values:
    * `submit` or `action` - Reference to an Apex action to execute using the `$Action.Apex.ClassName` format.
    * `navigation_namedPage` - The API name of the page to navigate to.
    * `navigation_url` - The URL to navigate to.
* `callback` - Only to be used when the `action` type is specified. This should be a reference to an LWC action using
  the
  `$Action.LWC.ActionName` format. The special variable `$returnValue` can be used to reference the return value of the
  action.

#### Action Types

The `type` property determines how the button will behave when clicked. The following types are supported with their
respective behaviors:

* `submit`

To use this type the button must be placed inside a `Form` component. When clicked, the form will be submitted (the
Apex action referenced in the `src` property will be executed) receiving the form data as a Map.

* `action`

When clicked, the Apex action referenced in the `src` property will be executed.

* `navigation_namedPage`

When clicked, the user will be navigated to the page referenced in the `src` property. The `src` property should
evaluate to a String containing the API name of the page to navigate to.

* `navigation_url`

When clicked, the user will be navigated to the URL referenced in the `src` property. The `src` property should
evaluate to a String containing the URL to navigate to.

**Example**

```json
{
  "label": "Checkout",
  "type": "action",
  "src": $Action.Apex.CreateSalesOrder(
  "00A56643Dr563lcwkL"
  ),
  "callback": $Action.Lwc.GoToNamedPage(
{
  "name": "checkout__c",
  "id": $returnValue
}
)
}
```

For more on how to call Apex actions, see [Apex Interoperability](#Apex-Interoperability)

#### Callbacks

After executing an action, it is common to want to react to that action in some way. This is accomplished
through callbacks and LWC Interoperability. To reference an LWC callback,
use the `$Action.Lwc.ActionName(parameter_expression)` format.

The following LWC action names are supported:

* `GoToNamedPage`

This action navigates to a named page. A Map expression with a "name" property must be provided containing
the page's API Name.
To add query parameters to the URL, pass as many extra keys to the map as you wish.

```json
{
  "name": "pageApiName",
  "namedParam1": "success",
  "namedParam2": "any_value"
}
```

* `GoToUrl`

This action navigates to a URL. A Map expression with a "name" property must be provided containing the URL.

```json
{
  "name": "pageApiName"
}
```

* `Reload`

This action reloads the page.

### Input Text

> `Form` compatible

The `Input Text` component allows you to display a text input. It can be used
in a community page.

#### Properties

- `Label` - The label to display.
- `Name` - Unique name for the input. This will be used as the key in the form data during submission.
- `Required` - Whether the input is required or not.
- `Error Message` - The error message to display when the input is required and empty.

### Nav Bar

The `Nav Bar` component allows you to display a navigation bar with links to other pages. It can be used
in a community page.

#### Properties

- `Formula Expression` - The expression to evaluate. This expression should evaluate to a map with the following format:

```json
{
  "logo": {
    "name": "<<String value or expression>>",
    "url": "<<String value or expression>>"
  },
  "menuItems": [
    {
      "label": "<<String value or expression>>",
      "url": "<<String value or expression>>"
    }
  ],
  "callToAction": "<<Expression that evaluates to a Button action>>"
}
```

> The `callToAction` property is optional.

#### Sample Usage

The following formula can be used to query for Navigation Menu Items and display them in the Nav Bar component:

```bash
{
	"logo": {
		"name": "Example",
		"imagePath": "https://example.com/img/logos/primary.svg",
		"url": "/"
	},
	"menuItems": Query(NavigationMenuItem(where: Status = "Live")["Label", "Target", "Status", "Position"]) 
		-> SORT("Position")

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

### Setup

Create a scratch org by running:

```bash
sfdx force:org:create -f config/dev.json -a Expression --setdefaultusername
```

Push the source to the scratch org:

```bash
sfdx force:source:push
```

Assign the `Expression Admin` permission set to the default user:

```bash
sfdx force:user:permset:assign -n Expression_Admin
```

#### Debugging

While debugging, you might find it helpful to see the generated AST for
a given expression.

The source code includes a `Visitor` implementation
whose sole purpose is to do this, `AstPrinter`. When enabled, it will
print the AST to the logs.

You can enable it by passing an `expression.Configuration` option to the `run`
method with the `printAst` option enabled :

```apex
expression.Configuration config = new expression.Configuration().printAst();
Object value = expression.Evaluator.run('AND(true, false, 1=1)', config);
// Outputs to the logs:
// (AND true false (= 1 1))
```

### Running tests

Run the tests with:

```bash
sfdx force:apex:test:run
```
