## Playground

The Expression Playground tab allows you to test and evaluate formulas in a
visual way.

![Expression Playground](./../expression-playground.png)

With it, you can quickly test and validate expressions, and see the results
in real-time. You can also use it to learn about the different operators and
functions available.

To provide a context for the expression, you can also specify a record Id (optional).
