`Expression Components` is a UI library that can be deployed independently of the core library.
These components give you powerful configuration abilities, as their configuration properties are powered
by the `Expression` language.

## Installation

Install with SF CLI:

```shell
sf package install --apex-compile package --wait 20 --package {% $componentPackageId %}
```

Install with SFDX CLI:

```shell
sfdx force:package:install --apexcompile package --wait 20 --package {% $componentPackageId %}
```

## Site Context

### Query Parameters

From any expression you can access query parameters for the current page using
the global context variable prefix `@` followed by the query parameter name:

```
"Hello @name"
```

where `name` is a query parameter in the current page.

{% callout type="warning" %}
All components supported in communities are meant to be used within an LWR template. They might
work in Aura templates, but keep in mind they developed and tested with LWR in mind.
{% /callout %}
